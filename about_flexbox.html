            <strong>LET’S TALK FOOD</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hey guys! My name is Jessica and I'm studying UX design and Business at the University of Michigan. 
            I am a huge foodie, so a lot of my hobbies involve food, and I especially love sharing it with my family and friends!
            You'll find many different recipes from different cuisines here, so I hope you're not picky!  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            You’re here! Have fun, and I hope you find something (or many things) you love.
          </p>
